# 01 - If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: BSF
# 02 - If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: BFS (DFS will take too long)
# 03 - If the tree is very wide: DFS (BFS will need too much memory)
# 04 - If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS
# 05 - Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS
# 06 - Finding the shortest path: BFS
