    -> Merge Sort
    -> Pros:
        - Guarantee a Time Complexity of O(nlog n)

    -> Pros:
        - Works really well with smalls inputs and almost sorted data
        - Space Complexity O(1)
    -> Cons:
        - If data is not so sorted, it can have a O(n²)

# 06 - Temperature Records for the past 50 years in Canada:

        - In average, have O(nlog n) for Time Complexity
        - Space Complexity of O(log n)
    -> Cons:
